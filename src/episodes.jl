"""
    EpisodesBuffer(traces::AbstractTraces)

Wraps an `AbstractTraces` object, usually the container of a `Trajectory`. 
`EpisodesBuffer` tracks the indexes of the `traces` object that belong to the same episodes.
To that end, it stores 
1. an vector `sampleable_inds` of Booleans that determine whether an index in Traces is legally sampleable
(i.e., it is not the index of a last state of an episode);
2. a vector `episodes_lengths` that contains the total duration of the episode that each step belong to;
3. an vector `step_numbers` that contains the index within the episode of the corresponding step.

This information is used to correctly sample the traces. For example, if we have an episode that lasted 10 steps, the buffer stores 11 states. sampleable_inds[i] will
be true for the index of the first ten steps, and 0 at the index of state number 11. episodes_lengths will be 11
consecutive 10s (the episode saw 11 states but 10 steps occured). step_numbers will be 1 to 11.

If `traces` is a capacitated buffer, such as a CircularArraySARTSTraces, then these three vectors will also be circular.

EpisodesBuffer assumes that individual transitions are `push!`ed. Appending is not yet supported.

    PartialNamedTuple(::NamedTuple)

Wraps a NamedTuple to signal an EpisodesBuffer that it is pushed into that it should 
ignore the fact that this is a partial insertion. Used at the end of an episode to
complete multiplex traces before moving to the next episode.
